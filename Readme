The objective of this work is to deliver a program allowing an user to execute commands from a remote machine using TCP/IP. 

Requirement :
    	• Ensure that execute "exit" close the connexion for both (client, server) and ends the program (client)
	• Ensure that long result from command is sent entirely (ex: date --help)
	• Ensure that the user has a session on the server machine (/etc/passwd, for debian based operating system)
	• Ensure that if one machine become unreachable (exit cases (files access, strings overflow*), program interruption), the other one properly close the connexion. The client then finish its execution, the server waits for a new connexion. 


Test cases :

- Launch program with a wrong format (for example '@', '@hello', 'hello@') => OK
- Launch client before server => OK
- Launch server, then client => OK
	- type exit => OK
	- type enter => OK
	- type a command without parameter (ex: date) => OK
	- type command with parameter (ex: date --help) => OK

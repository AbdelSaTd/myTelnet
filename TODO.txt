- Ensure the client have access on the distant server OK!
- Manage properly the exit when a error happen (closing of socket, and files) for both client and server.
- Manage this case :
    When the server exit because of an error (cannot open a file), notify the error to the client before closing the client.
		Or close the connexion right after the client send a message to the server and get no response
- Manage a delimiter with more than one character
- Optimize compilation through Makefile

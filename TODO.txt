The next things to do :

- Refactor the code (malloc)
- Manage this case :
    When the server exit because of an error (cannot open a file), notify the error to the client before closing the client.
		Or close the connexion right after the client send a message to the server and get no response
- Manage a delimiter with more than one character (more robust)
